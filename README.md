# Deep Learning

This repository contains a collection of deep learning exercises focused on building, training, and improving neural networks using different tools and approaches.

## High-Level Overview of Topics Covered

- Implementing neural networks from scratch using NumPy (without deep learning frameworks)
- Building and training models using TensorFlow and **PyTorch**
- Regularization techniques such as Dropout and L2
- Hyperparameter tuning and experiment tracking with tools like TensorBoard
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
